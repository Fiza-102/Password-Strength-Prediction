## Overview
A user must create a strong password so that their data is secure from unauthorized users.
I have build a model to predict the password strength using the Logistic
Regression Machine Learning Algorithm & Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python.
So, using this model, I will predict whether the password strength is strong or average, or weak.

## Dataset
The dataset contains around 670,000 different passwords of different strengths. The strength of a
password is denoted by a number i.e., if
- password strength=2, it is a strong password
- password strength=1, it is an average strength password
- password strength=0, it is a weak password
